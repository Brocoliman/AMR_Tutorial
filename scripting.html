        This tutorial assumes that you already know how to make a basic Marble Race. If not, go the <a href = "https://broco
          liman.github.io/amr_tutorial/tutorial.html"> tutorials page</a>.
        When the code given has an asterisk(*) in a part, do not type the asterisk; instead follow the direction in the asterisk 
        after the code, and it usually means that the code is custom.
        Note that the tutorials below are just a foundation. The contraptions you make are actually based off all of them.
        If you have anything to say, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy5_0G6mbM8wOdEBmNz4VCZIT-ugt2OFZfTy6rJRH9oWEYVQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1">go here</a>.

      <div>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some of the sections are conditions, for example, onCollide, that triggers a certain code, while some of them
              are variables of the object, for example, the text</li>
          <li>The onCollide code is triggered when another object touches it</li>
          <li>The update code is triggered every 60th of a second</li>
          <li>You can create variables in the top bar below the scripting description</li>
          <li>A variable lock can be used so an object, especially teleporters that teleport other teleporters, does not get any of its attributes changed. 
              They can be made by putting a certain variable set in the update section</li>
          <li>For more tips regarding the script, check out the <a href="https://algodoo.fandom.com/wiki/Thyme">Algodoo Scripting Wiki</a></li>

         Teleporter 
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        Teleporters are the most important things in Marble Races. You may not even see it in action; it might be in the backstage!
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>
          To make a teleporter, go along with the following steps:
        </h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Make 2 custom sized shapes</li>
          <li>Go in ones script menu, and in onCollide, in the "(e)=>{}"(you never put your code outside of that, unless the section doesn't have it), type:
               e.other.pos = my.*varx</li>
          <li>Go in the other object's script, and in the postStep, write: my.*varx = pos</li> 
          <li>*The code after the asterisk is a variable, so you can customize the name, as long as both are same</li>
          <li>The teleporter will only work if an object goes in the right one, which is the one coded in Step 2. Also, the teleporter won't work on an 
              object that doesn't have any common collision layer as the teleporter. It is best to cancel out all the collision layers
              of the Step 3 rectangle</li>
          <li>There!! Try it out ;)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>
         Velocity Pads 
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        Same as teleporters, lots of backstage action. These velocity pads apply a certain velocity(direction and speed) to an object. 
        These are unarguably the most used element in Marble Racing.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>
          To start, go along with the following steps:
        </h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Make a custom shape(best to use a rectangle)</li>
          <li>Go in the object's script, and in onCollide, type: e.other.vel = *[x,y]</li>
          <li>*The coordinates sends the object in that x(horizontal) and y(vertical). Note that the velocity pads do not add on to the 
              the marble's(or any colliding object's) velocity; they simply replace them. </li>
        </ol>
     </div>

        <h1>
         Gravity Pads
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        Gravity Pads are used pretty commonly in classic races. After this section, there won't be any property changing pads.
        You'll have to figure it out by yourself!!!

        <h5>
          To start, go along with the following steps:
        </h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Make a custom shape(best to use a rectangle)</li>
          <li>Go in the object's script, and in onCollide, type: e.other.density = *x</li>
          <li>*The smaller the number, the higher the marble will float to! As a general guide, 0.01 keeps the marble where it is, and 0.005 makes it 
                float up at a smooth pace</li>
          <li>Try it out!!</li>

        <h1>
         Variables
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        Variables are the building blocks of programming and scripting. They may not seem useful at the moment, but I will show you the variable magic
        later on...
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>
          To create a variable, go along with the following steps:
        </h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Go in an object's script, and in the bar below the description, type *x=*y </li>
          <li>*This is really important!!!!!
              x is the name of the variable and y is the value it holds.
            <ul>
              <li>Adding "scene.my." to the left of the name will make it global</li>
              <li>Making a variable global will, of course, let any object access it, and if it is change from one object,
                  it will be changed throughout the whole scene</li>
              <li>If you don't want the variable to be global, add an underscore(_) to the left of the name.
                  This way, it only creates the variable for this object</li>
              <li>If you don't add anything to the variable name, it will only appear as a variable in that property(or curly bracket)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You don't have to know about all of these, but they are just for reference
            <ul>
              <li>There are 4 types of basic types of values for y: integer, float, string, boolean</li>
              <li>Integers are a non-decimal numeric value. CollideSets(collision layer values) use these</li>
              <li>Floats are decimal-including number. Angles might include these</li>
              <li>Strings are a piece of text, put in quotation marks. Texts use these</li>
              <li>Booleans are just true and false. Killer and Immortal use these</li>
              <li>There are several more value types</li>
              <li>Array are a list of basic value, which don't have to be the same type. Velocity and positions use them</li>
              <li>Codes(the bits of scripts) can be stored as a value. OnCollide and similar properties use these</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
