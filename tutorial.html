      The actual marble race making tutorial can work on mobile, though.

        To start, go along with the following steps:
      </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the<a href="http://www.algodoo.com/download/"> Algodoo Download Page</a></li>
        <li>Scroll down to the Free Downloads and choose the download corresponding to your computer</li>

       Basic Tools

    <div>
      Go to the bottom right corner, and you will see a toolkit. Go ahead, experiment all you want!
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Several tools, when used with a right click, may redirect to another tool</li>
        <li>If you use shift with a drawing, erasing, or cutting tool, it operates the tool in a line, for example, when you hold
            shift while erasing, it erases in a straight line</li>
        <li>Many(Not to mention, all) tools have checkboxes on the right of the toolkit for options</li>

       Making Marbles 
      </h1>

    <div>
      <h5>
        To start, go along with the following steps:
      </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the Circle Tool to create a circle of your desired size</li>
        <li>Right click on the circle, and click on appearance. 
          Don't get too bewildered, and if you do, you will regret clicking on the script menu
          (The script menu will be the most important thing you use later on)</li>
        <li>Take a look at the checkboxes below the color picker. Make sure Borders, Protractor, and most importantly, Circle Pie
          are unchecked. Then, of course, pick the color of your marble</li>
        <li>These are the 15 standard marble colors for me in RGB: </li> 
        <ol>
          <li>Red(255,0,0)</li> 
          <li>Maroon(135,0,0)</li> 
          <li>Orange(255,140,0)</li> 
          <li>Brown(135,70,0)</li>
          <li>Yellow(255,255,0) </li>
          <li>Olive(135,135,0) </li>
          <li>Lime(0,255,0) </li>
          <li>Green(0,135,0) </li>
          <li>Cyan(0,255,255) </li>
          <li>Blue(0,0,255) </li>
          <li>Magenta(255,0,255)</li>
          <li>Purple(135,0,255) </li>
          <li>Black(0,0,0) </li>
          <li>Gray(135,135,135)</li>
          <li>White(255,255,255)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Re-enter the menu, and go to the Geometry Actions. Click Add Tracer. The tracer will appear on the center of the marble and an outlined circle</li>
        <li>Exit the Marble menu, and go to the Tracer menu. Set the size of the Tracer in the Tracer section to near the size of the marble, but not 
            bigger. If you do set the tracer bigger, then the Marble will have an outline and the trace on the Marble will look weird</li>
        <li>Go to Selection in the Tracer menu, and click "Move selected to back". This way, the tracer won't show up in front of the Marble. Test it, and 
          drag the marble around with the drag tool!</li>
        <li>To make more Marbles, hold the control(or command for Mac) key and drag the currently existing marble.</li>

       Simple Tracks & THE BOWL 
      </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      The track is a foundation of Marble Racing. The bowl is known for its originality.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>
        To make a Simple Track, go along with the following steps:
      </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>It is preferred to use rectangles than the brush, so make a long rectangle and color it with your marble race theme. 
          If there is no theme, use black(for everything besides the marbles and transparent stuff).</li>
        <li>Try making all the track rectangles the same height</li>
        <li>*For Later reference*If you change the collision layer of the marbles, make sure the track also has that layer
            checked, unless you don't want the marble to collide with it</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        To make a Bowl, go along with the following steps:
      </div>
      <div>  
      <ol>
          <li>Make a rectangle(size is on you)</li>
          <li>Get the Eraser Tool, and set the size of it to how big you want the inner bowl to be </li>
          <li>From top to near bottom of the rectangle, hold shift while dragging down with the eraser tool, and make sure it is completely vertical</li>
          <li>Set the size of the eraser to slightly bigger(not too much) than the marbles</li>
          <li>Use this eraser to carve a hole at the bottom of the bowl</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>
       Spinners 
      </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      Spinners are used throughout every marble race. From Classic Marbles Races to fully themed Marble Racees, spinners is an important
      part of Marble Races to be able to make.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>
        To start, go along with the following steps:
      </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Make a custom sized rectangle(The height should bee 5 times the width)</li>
        <li>Hold Ctrl or Command, based on your computer, and then click on the rectangle. This creates a copy of it</li>
        <li>Click(yep, only click, do not select)the rectangle, then Turn it 90 degrees. The original rectangle below should stay where it was at the beginning</li>
        <li>Now you should have a plus sign. These next steps are very important.</li>
        <li>From the plus sign, select the rectangle that has overlaps the other, and go in the menu. Then, click on Combine Shapes, and after that, 
            click Add. Then exit the menu. Now, delete the rectangle that overlaps the other. You will now see just a plus sign, no overlaps</li>
        <li>Enter the plus sign menu, and go to Geometry Action. Click on add axle. The Axle will be shown on the plus sign(now about to be a spinner)</li>
        <li>Go in the Axle menu, and turn the "a"(In the HSVA slider section) in the Appearance section to 0</li>
        <li>Go to the Axle section, and click the check on Motor. 2 sliders will appear, and set the one that says Motor Torque to the max(or maybe 
          100 ^ 1000, which sets it to infinite). The Motor Speed is to your choice</li>
